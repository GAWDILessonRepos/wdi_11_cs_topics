# General Assembly Computer Science

## Instructions

Tables will be set up by topic around the room. You will eventually visit all tables. You're working in groups, but your progress is self-paced. Start at either the Stack, Queue or Linked List tables. Work with others to complete all tasks for the topics of that table.
